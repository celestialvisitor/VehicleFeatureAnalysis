Reviews:   * One of the more attractive interiors in the segment at an affordable price is tough to overlook. A refined 4-cylinder engine offers respectable fuel economy due in part to the new 9-speed automatic transmission. If its power you seek, the Pentastar V6 serves up 295 horsepower. Source: KBB.com   * Strong V6 engine; composed ride and handling; high-quality interior materials; slick infotainment interface; available all-wheel drive. Source: Edmunds   * The advanced engineering of the redesigned 2015 Chrysler 200 results in highly efficient, refined performance. The exterior design blends coupe-like proportions with a tasteful fit and finish. A dynamic stance, wind-swept profile, finely sculpted curves and aggressive wheel-to-body proportions result in a sophisticated road presence. The 200 redefines the sedan interior. A traditional center console is replaced with one that is ergonomic and space efficient. It combines climate controls, the Electric Park Brake and connectivity functions with storage features. A connection to a USB or auxiliary media hub is located under the cup holder. Controls for the available dual-zone automatic temperature control are in short reach and easy to use. The 200 fuel economic ratings speak for themselves. The 2.4L Tigershark MultiAir II four-cylinder engine provides up to 36mpg HWY, while the available 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine delivers up to 31mpg HWY with 295hp. The Rotary E-shift features a wide gear ratio spread provides smooth, indecipherable transfer between gears at all speeds. Standard on all 200 models (except the LX) the Uconnect 5.0 System includes a high-resolution 5in touchscreen, one year of SiriusXM Radio, Integrated Voice Command, Bluetooth technology, a media hub with mobile device integration and more. To keep driving safe, 200 models include standard steel cage construction and eight airbags that help deliver excellent occupant protection in front, side and rear impacts. Advanced accident avoidance features include available Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist. Class-exclusive features include available Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go functions, available Forward Collision Warning, and available Parallel Park Assist.

Reviews:   * While many midsize sedans are plain-vanilla, the Mazda6 spices the segment up with dramatic exterior styling, innovative technology and a significant dollop of fun-to-drive. Source: KBB.com   * When function and form are treated as one, engineering is elevated to an art form. The all-new Mazda6 is the product of engineer and designer working in unison, from start to finish, daring to reimagine the automobile as a whole. It is the true definition of the modern sports sedan. The new 2.5L SKYACTIV-G gasoline engine takes the technology of its 2.0L predecessor and pushes the boundaries of innovation even further. Mazda engineers increased its torque output to 185 lb-ft, which means you get more power transferred to your wheels for significantly better off-the-line and cornering performance, all without compromising fuel efficiency. Combine it with the ultra-responsive 6-speed SKYACTIV-MT manual or the smooth 6-speed SKYACTIV-Drive Sport automatic transmission and the result: 184 horsepower and an astounding EPA-estimated 38 MPG hwy. It all begins when you slide into the luxurious driver's sport seat and fire up the engine with the push button start. With Mazda's newly available Commander Switch, you can control the available navigation system, sound system and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming conveniently from the center console. Other available features include leather trimmed upholstery and heated sports seats. The available fully integrated in-dash navigation system with a 5.8-inch touch-screen display is powered by TomTom, the industry leader in navigation systems featuring intuitive voice recognition. Crisp, immersive sound is delivered through an available 11-speaker Bose Centerpoint Surround Sound System with AudioPilot ambient noise compensation technology. With the SKYACTIV-Body, SKYACTIV-Chassis and intuitive safety technologies, Mazda6 is built to protect. Safety features include six standard airbags, should the airbags deploy standard E911 notification uses Bluetooth and your paired phone to call 911 automatically. Available Blind Spot Monitoring uses motion-detecting technology to scan your blind spots.

Reviews:   * If youre seeking a well-constructed luxury car heavy on safety, luxury and respectability, Mercedes-Benzs 2015 E-Class sedan, coupe, convertible and wagon have much to offer. The E-Class clean styling seems to stand the test of time, another plus for those who dont flip their cars every two years. Source: KBB.com   * Superb ride; wide variety of body styles; strong engines; smooth and efficient diesel; extensive safety features. Source: Edmunds   * With a modern interpretation of design cues made iconic by their legendary predecessors, the Mercedes-Benz E-Class delivers a style that is both timeless and trendsetting. Now available in two front-end treatments: bold or sport, a driver can choose a coupe, convertible, sedan, or a wagon. In addition, the E-Class offers a slew of engines ranging from a 2.1L turbodiesel, a 3.5L V6, a 3.5L V6 mated to a hybrid electric motor, a 4.6 V8, and an incredibly strong 5.5L AMG V8. Available 4MATIC all-wheel drive adds to your control as well. The body rests upon fine alloy wheels and four-lamp LED headlights help increase the visibility of the vehicle to oncoming traffic. LED technology also delivers quicker illumination of the brake lamps. On the inside, modifications include a host of available upholstery, including MB-Tex upholstery or leather. The seats, for four to five passengers depending on model, are beyond comfortable with more than adequate headroom and ergonomic features. Featuring a high-resolution color-LCD display and a central controller on the console, the Cockpit Management and Data (COMAND) system gives convenient control of audio, video, hands-free calling and optional navigation functions. An advanced system of nine standard airbags offers enhanced occupant protection. ATTENTION ASSIST continuously monitors different parameters of driving behavior, and can automatically alert the driver with both visual and audible warnings. Adaptive braking technology integrates a suite of advances. Predictive brake priming sets the pads closer to the discs for more immediate response when brakes are applied. In the rain, automatic brake drying periodically applies the brakes just enough to sweep water build-up from the discs.

Reviews:   * If you want your upscale SUV to accent ""sport,"" then the 2015 BMW X3 may just be the ticket. Of course, with plenty of cargo space and a choice of two fuel-efficient engines, its not short on utility, either. Source: KBB.com   * Large selection of potent and reasonably efficient engines; high-quality cabin; generous passenger and cargo room; crisp handling; comfortable rear seat. Source: Edmunds   * In 2015, BMW has made some subtle refinements to the stylish, five passenger X3. Still designed to convey elegance, agility, and power, its sleek silhouette and the new redesigned 3-dimensional kidney grille give it a bold and powerful face. The specially designed taillights show off its unique style and once inside, one immediately notices the space offered by high seating positions for extended shoulder room, legroom, and headroom. All without forgetting the luxury details BMW is known for. 2015 introduces the first xDrive28d diesel option, which makes use of the same 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo-diesel that powers the 328d, making 180hp and 280 lb-ft of torque. AWD is standard in all models now, and the fuel-efficient turbocharged four-cylinder is standard in the xDrive28i model. This base 2L engine gives 240hp and goes 0-60mph in the mid-six second range, while bumping up to the 3L six-cylinder with two sport modes can get there in five seconds flat at 300hp. Standard is the buttery smooth eight-speed automatic transmission. The X3 is known for remarkable passing power and ability to be first on the on-ramp. This sports activity vehicle is also a quiet, comfortable ride; complimented by equally impressive appointments such as eight-way power front seats clad in leatherette upholstery with contrast stitching. Standard highlights include a power tailgate and rain-sensing windshield wipers with automatic headlight control. BMW offers a Technology Package that includes USB connectivity and Bluetooth with smartphone integration, in addition to navigation and iDrive refinements. Finally, the X3 offers a 12 speaker, 205-watt sound system and a slew of safety features including significant airbags, anti-theft alarm, and lower anchors and tethers for car seats.

Reviews:   * Muscular V6 engine; sharp handling; strong brakes; easy-to-use high-tech features. Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 INFINITI Q60 Convertible is the right choice for those looking for the ultimate in sporty luxury. The Q60 is the new moniker for the previous generation INFINITI G37 Coupe and Convertible. The Q60's 3.7 liter V6 unleashes 328-hp and features exclusive VVEL technology that continually tunes valve lift and timing for quicker response and broader torque curve, even while improving fuel economy and emissions. IPL models feature a 348-hp 3.7-liter IPL-tuned V6 with 276 lb-ft of torque. The high 7th gear allows lower-rpm cruising for greater fuel efficiency. Shift through all seven seamlessly in automatic mode, or switch into manual with Downshift Rev Matching and use the available solid-magnesium paddle shifters for a more hands-on connection. Or opt for the 6-speed manual transmission and take direct control for max performance. The unique collaboration of INFINITI designers and engineers created the Q60's massive 14-inch front rotors and sculpted 4-piston front calipers that grab faster and with more finite control than a sliding caliper design. Press the brake pedal and you will feel their precise feedback and gain a greater sense of power and control. From the glow of the gauges and knobs, to the designed feel of every switch and button, the interior unifies elegant, functional design with handcrafted details. In addition, the 11-speaker INFINITI Studio on Wheels by Bose was designed to help music retain its richly-authentic sound. INFINITI engineers created the first manufacturer system that delivers the music's power from the front, with sound washing through the cabin from front to back, as in a live performance. Your INFINITI transforms the reality of traffic with technology that will help effortlessly manage your speed and maintain your distance to the car ahead. When traffic slows, Intelligent Cruise Control will automatically slow your vehicle to help maintain a safe distance, then resume your set cruising speed when traffic clears. Source: The Manufacturer Summary   * For those who want a stylish sub-$50K luxury vehicle with genuine sporting credentials and a relatively attractive price tag, the 2014 INFINITI Q60 is a safe bet.

Reviews:   * Whether youre looking for a 5-passenger luxury SUV that can sip the least fuel possible, a luxury SUV that can rip to 174 mph, or a luxury SUV that splits that difference one way or the other, the 2015 Mercedes-Benz M-Class is a good bet. Source: KBB.com   * Very fuel-efficient diesel; very quick gasoline engines; serene ride; rich interior appointments; roomy backseat; top crash scores. Source: Edmunds   * Every element of the 2015 M-Class cabin is thoughtfully engineered and elegantly crafted to make you feel at home, and in control, on any road. The standard 19-inch alloy wheels further accent the already stark design of the M-Class. Bright white LED Daytime Running Lamps help increase the visibility of your vehicle to oncoming traffic by illuminating front lights whenever the car is switched on. On the inside, wood trim adorns the console, dash, steering wheel and doors. MB-Tex upholstery offers a rich appearance and supple leather-like feel, even in cold weather. Electrically heated front seats quickly take the chill out of even the coldest day. 60/40 split-folding rear seat backs with flip-forward seat cushions allow for a truly flat cargo floor. The Cockpit Management and Data (COMAND) system features a high-resolution color-LCD display. This is utilized to manage audio, video, and other hands free calling and navigation functions. The M-Class features a 302hp 3.5L V6 with up to 6,600lbs of towing power or a 329hp or 3.0L biturbo V6 with 7,200lbs. The 7-speed automatic has been made even smoother, more responsive and more efficient while paddle shifters allow you to manually upshift and downshift with just a flick of your fingers. Powerful 4-wheel disc brakes grant you the all of the stopping power that you need. Mercedes-Benz is concerned with keeping the family safe, and the quality of the safety options present on the M-Class is proof of that. A suite of standard air bags offers advanced protection. A driver's knee air bag supplements the dual-stage front air bags. Enjoy the strong, controlled stopping power of dual-circuit power-assisted 4-wheel disc brakes, backed by an Antilock Braking System.

Source: KBB.com   * Standard all-wheel drive; excellent outward visibility; spacious cabin; top crash test scores. Source: Edmunds   * Introducing the all new 2015 Subaru Legacy. Legacy features completely revised and retuned steering and suspension, resulting in both improved handling and a quieter, more composed ride. Standard on all models Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive makes for better stability, efficiency, and a quicker response to road conditions. It is designed for optimal balance and an even distribution of power for maximum traction. The combination of the advanced SUBARU BOXER engine and a highly efficient Lineartronic CVT allows the Legacy to get up to 36 mpg hwy with the 2.5L engine. You can also opt for the potent 3.6L engine as well. Legacy's completely new and spacious interior features soft-touch high-quality materials throughout. Available features also include a 10-way adjustable driver's seat with 2-position memory, heated rear seats and rear A/C vents to bring front-seat comfort to the entire cabin. The available All-Weather Package includes heated seats, heated side mirrors, and a windshield wiper de-icer to improve both comfort and visibility. With EyeSight technology, two cameras above the rearview mirror of the Legacy can monitor traffic and react to conditions before you can. An alert will be sounded along with a visual warning when it senses danger of a collision. It can even apply the brakes automatically if you don't. EyeSight also optimizes cruise control and can warn drivers when they're swaying outside their lane. The new Subaru STARLINK infotainment system brings smartphone entertainment and communication to your dashboard, with an available 7-inch in-dash touch screen and voice controls as well as voice-activated GPS navigation. Also available is a 12-speaker, Harman Kardon 576-watt equivalent premium audio system.
